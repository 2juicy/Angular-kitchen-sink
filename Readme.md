Check this working demo: http://ng2.javascriptninja.io
====


The goal behind ng2Boilerplayer is to deliver an easy to start Angular 2 base application that includes the basis around what any solid single page application requires.

to install::
```
git clone https://github.com/born2net/ng2Boilerplate.git
cd ng2Boilerplate/
npm install
gulp LiveServer
```


(optionaly: copy node_modules/ angular2 and node_modules/rxjs from ./node_modules directory to root of project so TypeScript can find it in the path while transpiling. However you donâ€™t need these directories during runtime as system.js will load both libs from node_moduldes directory respectively)

What features of Angular does this app cover? well pretty much all the core stuff:

- Routing with Aync of modules (App1 and App2) on a per navigation basis
- jQuery integration the Angular way
- CommBroker for service management, value sharing and evet mediator 
- Global Consts
- Responsive design (on size change Angular components will react) 
- RX reactive operators and subscribers throughout the app
- Lots of standalone components such as Modal, Sliders, Todo, Tabs and more
- Shared state (Side menu and file menu)
- Dependency injection
- Dependency sharing
- App lifecycles
- Form and validation
- Node server side CRUD for RX calls
- Todo data model persistence and sync to node server via CRUD
- Subclass / Inheritance ES6 (Notes component) 
- Static shared lib and single reference file
- Themes
- Interfaces
- UI data binding / uni and 2 way
- Document generation
- and much more...
