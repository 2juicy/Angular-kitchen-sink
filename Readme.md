Check this working demo: http://ng2.javascriptninja.io
====


The goal behind ng2Boilerplayer is to deliver an easy to start Angular 2 base application that includes the basis around what any solid single page application requires.

to install::
```
git clone https://github.com/born2net/ng2Boilerplate.git
cd ng2Boilerplate/
npm install
gulp LiveServer
```


(optionaly: copy node_modules/angular2 and node_modules/rxjs from ./node_modules directory to root of project so TypeScript can find it in the path while transpiling.
 However you donâ€™t need these directories during runtime as system.js will load both libs from node_moduldes directory respectively)

What features of Angular does this app cover? well pretty much all the core stuff:

- Routing with Aync of modules (App1 and App2) on a per navigation basis

- CommBroker for service management, value sharing and evet mediator 
- Global Consts
- Responsive design (on size change Angular components will react) 
- RX reactive operators and subscribers throughout the app

- Shared state (Side menu and file menu)
- Dependency injection and decorators such as @Host
- Dependency sharing
- ES6 such as arrow functions, Map, let and more
- Hook into application lifecycles
- Form and validation (both via FormBuilder and manual creating Control Groups)
- Form observables and operations
- Node server side CRUD for RX calls
- Todo data model persistence and sync to node server via CRUD
- Subclass / Inheritance ES6 (Notes component) 
- Static shared lib and single reference file
