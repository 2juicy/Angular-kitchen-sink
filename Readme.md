ng2Boilerplate
=====================

An Angular 2 and Bootstrap easy to start, A-Z startup project
----------------

ready to be impressed with Angular 2?


Check this working demo: http://ng2.javascriptninja.io
====

this project is available in 2 flavors:
- webpack: https://github.com/born2net/ng2Boilerplate-webpack
- systemjs: https://github.com/born2net/ng2Boilerplate

The goal behind ng2Boilerplayer is to deliver an easy to start Angular 2 base application that includes the basis around what any solid single page application requires.

to install::
```
git clone https://github.com/born2net/ng2Boilerplate.git
cd ng2Boilerplate/
npm install
gulp LiveServer
```

and for your TypeScript compiler to transpile use the args of:
```
--target es5 --module system --experimentalDecorators --preserveConstEnums true --sourceMap true --emitDecoratorMetadata
```

(optionally: copy node_modules/angular2 and node_modules/rxjs from ./node_modules directory to root of project so TypeScript can find it in the path while transpiling.
 However you donâ€™t need these directories during runtime as system.js will load both libs from node_moduldes directory respectively)

What features of Angular does this app cover? well pretty much all the core stuff:

- System.js modulated async loader (not a fan of Webpack and it's black magic)
- Routing with Async of modules (App1 and App2) on a per navigation basis
- jQuery integration the Angular way via BrowserDomAdapter
- CommBroker dependency service, value sharing and mediator design pattern
- LocalStorage service
- Global Consts for event and vars registration
- Responsive design (on size change Angular components will react) 
- Rxjs reactive operators and subscribers throughout the app (some random examples as well)
- Rxjs Change detection strategy for improved rendering of page (OnPushObserve)
- Rxjs Node server side CRUD for Observable client to server calls
- Lots of standalone components such as Modal, Sliders, Todo, Tabs and more
- Shared state (Side menu and file menu)
- Dependency injection and decorators such as @Host
- Dependency sharing
- ES6 such as arrow functions, Map, let and more
- Hook into application lifecycles
- Form and validation (both via FormBuilder and manual creating Control Groups)
- Form observables and operations including Async piping and more
- Form promised based field validation
- Todo data model persistence and sync to node server via CRUD
- Subclass / Inheritance ES6 (Notes component) 
- Static shared lib and single reference file
- Theme service (supports 3 themes including Lite, Dark and Polymer)
- Pipes including grid sort and character counter
- Interfaces
- UI data binding / uni and 2 way
- Document generation
- and much more...
